# Template p5 project

My final project is meant to be an audio visualizer with calming colours that also incorporates some level of user interactivity. I want it to be a relaxing experience, somewhat like a particle cloud that we can move to some degree. I did not think that too much interactivity would be the best thing, because it would take away from the amount of factors I could make audio-reactive, so the size of each particle depends on the amplitude of each moment in the song. It is still interactive though, the movement of the mouse dictates both the movement of the particles and their colour. I tried to cover a variety of topics that we studied this term including arrays, images, changing states and objects.
